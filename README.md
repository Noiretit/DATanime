# datAnime

#### Description

---

datAnime is static responsive web page, an all-timer anime finder for the top 10 best animes from the year and genre selected.

datAnime is developed using Javascript as part of the first project on the Ironhack Web Development bootcamp (Web-Dev Fulltime 062020) using the Kitsu API.

#### MVP

---

- Responsive webpage (mobile-first, tablet, laptop, desktop).

- Displays the top 10 best anime (by score) from the selected year and genre in an ordered way (user-friendly).
- Nav-bar (containing a pop-up register form, a pop-up log-in form (forms with validation), FAQS link) and footer on every page.
- A Home-page with:
  - an anime finder form (by year AND genre).
- A results page with:
  - the top 10 animes of the year and genre, showing title, main genre and year.
- More detailed results page depending on the anime selected showing
  - title, genres (if more than one), aired year and synopsis.
- A FAQS page.

- User data stored in local storage.

#### Backlog

---

- Random anime facts on home-page.
- Once user is logged in, hide "register" and "log-in" from dropdown menu and show "log-out".
- More search options:
  - only by year (no genre)
  - only by genre (no year)
  - of all times (no year no genre)
- "Suggest me something": shows a random detailed anime from any year/genre/score.
- Carousel with random anime pictures in the background

#### Wireframes

---

#### Data structure

---
